#### About the Data: 

Water quality samples from 26 sites in Miami, FL are typically collected once a week, though frequency varies among the sites. The EPA has set the following standards for water considered safe for swimming:

**0-69** CFU/MPN per 100 mL enterococci per sample: **Safe for swimming** 

**70+** CFU/MPN per 100 mL enterococci per sample: **Not safe for swimming**

Enterococci are bacteria found in human and animal intestines. The EPA sets standards for levels in water to assess contamination and the presence of harmful pathogens. Elevated enterococci levels indicate unsafe water quality for swimming, prompting regulatory advisories to prevent waterborne illnesses.

70 CFU/MPN per 100 mL: This means that in every 100 milliliters (mL) of the water sample, there are an estimated 70 colony forming units or most probable number of Enterococci bacteria. The value indicates the bacterial load or concentration of Enterococci in the sample, and it's used as an indicator of water quality, especially in terms of potential contamination.

You may be surpised to learn that samples at some sites have estimated over 30,000 CPU/MPN per 100 mL! Significantly beyond the safety standards set by the EPA.
